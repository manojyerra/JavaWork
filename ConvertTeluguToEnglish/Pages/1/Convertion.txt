Maharshi... Very busy
Film is almost completed if script is completed, says hollywood film makers.
Their intention was that film making is not a big problem if planned.
However, this formula may not be applied everywhere.
Very importantly in telugu film industry.
Because... Here film making with star hero is like a mini war.
Though script is perfect, film making may be not completed on time.
Same amount of the time needs to be spend for pre-production and post-production.
In that case, releasing film on time is very difficult.
Same thing happend in the case of "Maharshi".
Initially thought to bring the movie on Ugadi.
After that it went to 26th April.
Now it is going to be released on May 9th.
This is all for fans, says film unit.
Should not compramise in any case if ......
In that case, It is natual to be late like this.
Busy atmosphere is there now on Maharshi sets.
They are completing movie without taking one second rest.
Movie is about preseting farmer's difficulties and tears.
To see what maheshbabu did for farmers, we have to watch 'Maharshi'
It is a picture of a scene when mahesh and director vamshi ............
Wanted to get married : Rana
Actor Rana says that his co-actor Prabhas has more patience and I like that quality in him.
Movie "NTR-Mahanayakudu' got released recently where in Rana acted as Chandra Babu Naidu role.
Currently he is busy in "Hadi Mere Sadhi" film shooting.
Recently Rana participated in a celebrity talk show.
On this occasion, he shared about his personal life.
'I never wanted to be first in the studies, but I am very much interested in fim making' he said.
Failed in 10th class.
My grandfather Rama naidu never worried about my education.
Because... He knows that I like editing and I am learning it.
That is why he tought, it would be good to have progress in the field of interest.
I failed in 10th class.
Later I moved to different schools to pass in the exams.
That time only, ram charan became friend to me.
My childhood passed in the film set, I grew up there.
I used to be in the top floor and shooting used to happen in the below floor.
I used to have breakfast in the set and go to school.
Prabhas should have done many.
The first thing I learnt from prabhas is "Be Patient"
He has lot of patience.
Prabhas worked so hard for the Bahubali movie, he became the backbone of the movie.
Prabhas got series of successes in that time.
Hits like "Darling", "Mirchi" have come.
How many movies he could have done in the five years which he spent for Bahubali movies, imagine how much he could have earn.
But he didn't care all these.
He worked with patience and dedication for Bahubali
That I liked very much.
I am lucky
Since my grandfather is a film producer, it became easy for me to come to the film industry and get success.
Not only that, I got the opportunity to choose the story that I liked.
It became possible because of my grandfather.
In this matter, I am lucky.
